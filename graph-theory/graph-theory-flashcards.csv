(Some people define a leaf edge as a leaf and then define a leaf vertex on top of it. These two sets of definitions are often used interchangeably.) A non-leaf vertex is an internal vertex. Sometimes, one vertex of the tree is distinguished, and called the root. A rooted tree is a tree with a root. Rooted trees are often treated as directed acyclic graphs with the edges pointing away from the root. Trees are commonly used as data structures in computer science (see tree data structure).";"graph-theory"
"triangle";" C3 is called a triangle.";"graph-theory"
"tripartite graph";" A graph that can be decomposed into three partite sets but not fewer.";"graph-theory"
"undirected edge";" An edge that disregards any sense of direction and treats both endvertices interchangeably.";"graph-theory"
"undirected";" A graph in which each edge symbolizes an unordered, transitive relationship between two nodes. Such edges are rendered as plain lines or arcs.";"graph-theory"
"unicyclic graph";" A graph that contains exactly one cycle.";"graph-theory"
"unidentified";" Nodes or edges which are not considered as individuals. Only the way in which they connect to the rest of the graph characterize unidentified nodes and edges.";"graph-theory"
"universal graph";" In a class K of graphs, a simple graph in which every element in K can be embedded as a subgraph.";"graph-theory"
"unweighted";" A graph in which all the relationships symbolized by edges are considered equivalent. Such edges are rendered as plain lines or arcs.";"graph-theory"
"valency";" A degree.";"graph-theory"
"vertex";" A basic element of a graph, drawn as a node or a dot. The vertex set of G is usually denoted by V(G), or V when there is no danger of confusion.";"graph-theory"
"vertex cut";" A cut set.";"graph-theory"
"walk";" An alternating sequence of vertices and edges, beginning and ending with a vertex, in which each vertex is incident to the two edges that precede and follow it in the sequence, and the vertices that precede and follow an edge are the endvertices of that edge. A walk is closed if its first and last vertices are the same, and open if they are different.";"graph-theory"
"weighted";" Weighted edges symbolize relationships between nodes which are considered to have some value, for instance, distance or lag time. Such edges are usually annotated by a number or letter placed beside the edge. Weighted nodes also have some value; this must be distinguished from identification.";"graph-theory"
"weighted graph";" A graph that associates a label (weight) with every edge in the graph. Weights are usually real numbers. They may be restricted to rational numbers or integers. Certain algorithms require further restrictions on weights; for instance, the Dijkstra algorithm works properly only for positive weights.";"graph-theory"
"weight of a subgraph";" The sum of the weights of the edges of the subgraph.";"graph-theory"
"Wiener index of a vertex";" v in a graph G, denoted by WG(v) is the sum of distances between v and all others.";"graph-theory"
"Wiener index of a graph";" G, denoted by W(G), is the sum of distances over all pairs of vertices.";"graph-theory"
"Wiener polynomial of an undirected graph";" Σ qd(u,v) over all unordered pairs of vertices u and v.";"graph-theory"
