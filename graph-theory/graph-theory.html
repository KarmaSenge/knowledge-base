<h1>Graph Theory</h1>
<p>Here is a glossary of Graph Theory from <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_graph_theory">Wikipedia</a>. You can download <a href="graph-theory-flashcards.csv">flashcards</a> to use with <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>. I also recommend the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/graphbook/">GraphBook</a> for further studying. The source code is on <a href="https://github.com/knomaton/kmdoc-kb">github</a>.</p>
<div class="definition" id="acyclic"><dt>acyclic</dt><dd>Of graph, such one that it does not contain any directed cycle. A finite, acyclic digraph with no isolated vertices necessarily contain at least one source and at least one sink. See also directed acyclic graph (DAG for short) for more.</dd></div>


<div class="definition" id="acyclic-graph"><dt>acyclic graph</dt><dd>A graph that contains no cycles.</dd></div>


<div class="definition" id="adjacent"><dt>adjacent</dt><dd>Two edges are adjacent if they have a node in common; two nodes are adjacent if they have an edge in common.</dd></div>


<div class="definition" id="anti-edge"><dt>anti-edge</dt><dd>An edge that &quot;is not there&quot;. More formally, for two vertices  and ,  is an anti-edge in a graph  if  is not an edge in . This means that there is either no edge between the two vertices or there is only an edge  from  to  if  is directed.</dd></div>

<div class="definition" id="adjacency-matrix"><dt>adjacency matrix</dt><dd>In computers, a finite, directed or undirected graph (with n vertices, say) is often represented by its adjacency matrix: an n-by-n matrix whose entry in row i and column j gives the number of edges from the i-th to the j-th vertex.</dd></div>


<div class="definition" id="adjacent-2"><dt>adjacent</dt><dd>Two vertices u and v are considered adjacent if an edge exists between them. We denote this by u ↓ v. In the above graph, vertices 1 and 2 are adjacent, but vertices 2 and 4 are not. The set of neighbors, called a (open) neighborhood NG(v) for a vertex v in a graph G, consists of all vertices adjacent to v but not including v. When v is also included, it is called a closed neighborhood, denoted by NG[v]. When stated without any qualification, a neighborhood is assumed to be open. The subscript G is usually dropped when there is no danger of confusion. In the example graph, vertex 1 has two neighbors: vertices 2 and 5. For a simple graph, the number of neighbors that a vertex has coincides with its degree.</dd></div>

Note that a graph is k-connected if and only if it contains k internally disjoint paths between any two vertices.

A vertex of degree 0 is an isolated vertex. A vertex of degree 1 is a leaf. In the example graph vertices 1 and 3 have a degree of 2, vertices 2,4 and 5 have a degree of 3 and vertex 6 has a degree of 1. If E is finite, then the total sum of vertex degrees is equal to twice the number of edges.</dd></div>


<div class="definition" id="degree-sequence"><dt>degree sequence</dt><dd>A list of degrees of a graph in non-increasing order (e.g. d1 ≥ d2 ≥ … ≥ dn). A sequence of non-increasing integers is realizable if it is a degree sequence of some graph.</dd></div>

<div class="definition" id="dual"><dt>dual</dt><dd>A dual, or planar dual when the context needs to be clarified, G<em> of a plane graph G is a graph whose vertices represent the faces, including any outerface, of G and are adjacent in G</em> if and only if their corresponding faces are adjacent in G. The dual of a planar graph is always a planar pseudograph (e.g. consider the dual of a triangle). In the familiar case of a 3-connected simple planar graph G (isomorphic to a convex polyhedron P), the dual G<em> is also a 3-connected simple planar graph (and isomorphic to the dual polyhedron P</em>).</dd></div>

Graphs with labeled edges or vertices are known as labeled, those without as unlabeled. More specifically, graphs with labeled vertices only are vertex-labeled, those with labeled edges only are edge-labeled.

The degree dΓ(v) of a vertex v is equal to the sum of its out- and in- degrees. When the context is clear, the subscript Γ can be dropped. Maximum and minimum out degrees are denoted by Δ+(Γ) and δ+(Γ); and maximum and minimum in degrees, Δ-(Γ) and δ-(Γ).(predecessor set) N-Γ(v) of a vertex v is the set of heads of arc going into v.</dd></div>


<div class="definition" id="incident"><dt>incident</dt><dd>An edgee connects two vertices; these two vertices are said to be incident to that edge, or, equivalently, that edge incident to those two vertices. All degree-related concepts have to do with adjacency or incidence.</dd></div>
