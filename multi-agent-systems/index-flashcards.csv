"Multiagent system";"is a collection of multiple autonomous agents, each acting towards its objectives while all interacting in a shared environment, being able to communicate and possibly coordinate their actions.";"multi-agent-systems"
"Agent";"[Russell & Norvig] An agent is anything that can perceive its environment (through its sensors) and act upon that environment (through its effectors).<br>[Wooldridge & Jennings] An agent is a computer system that is situated in some environment, and that is capable of autonomous action in this environment in order to meet its design objectives/delegated goals.";"multi-agent-systems"
"autonomous";"the agent is self goal-directed and acts without requiring user initiation and guidance; it can choose its own goal and the way to achieve it; its behavior is determined by its experience; we have no direct control over it";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties"
"reactive";"the agent maintains an ongoing interaction with its environment, and responds to changes that occur in it";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties"
"proactive";"the agent generates and attempts to achieve goals; it is not driven solely by events but takes the initiative";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties"
"sociable";"the agent interacts with other agents (and possibly humans) via cooperation, coordination, and negotiation; it is aware and able to reason about other agents and how they can help it achieve its own goals";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties"
"coordination";"is managing the interdependencies between actions of multiple agents (not necessarily cooperative)";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties"
"cooperation";"is working together as a team to achieve a shared goal";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties"
"negotiation";"is the ability to reach agreements on matters of common interest";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties"
"Agent function";"Agent’s behavior is described by the agent function that maps percept sequences to actions.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties agent-behavior"
"Agent program";"runs on a physical architecture to produce agent function.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties agent-behavior"
"Rational agent";"chooses whichever action maximizes the expected value of the performance measure given the percept sequence to date and whatever bulit-in knowledge the agent has.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties agent-behavior"

"Simple Reflex Agents";"chooses the next action on the basis of the current percept only.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties hierarchy-of-agents"
"Model-based Reflex Agent";"Keeps track of the world by extracting relevant information from percepts and storing it in its memory.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties hierarchy-of-agents"
"Goal-based Agents";"Goal-based agents are more flexible, they use search and planning.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties hierarchy-of-agents"
"Utility-based Agents";"use the utility function to choose the most desirable action/course of actions to take.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties hierarchy-of-agents"
"Utility";"is a function that maps a state onto a real number; it captures “quality” of a state. If an agent prefers one world state to another state then the former state has higher utility for the agent.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties hierarchy-of-agents"
"Intelligent agent";"is autonomous, proactive, reactive and sociable.";"multi-agent-systems autonomous-agent-properties summary"
"Auction";"mechanism for allocating resource among self-interested agents<br>[Shoham & Leyton-Brown 2009] An auction is a protocol that allows agents (=bidders) to indicate their interests in one or more resources and that uses these indications of interest to determine both an allocation of resources and a set of payments by the agents.";"multi-agent-systems auctions"

"Common value";"the good has the same value to all agents example: a 100 dollar note";"multi-agent-systems auctions valuation-models"
"Private value";"an agent A’s valuation of the good is independent from other agent’s valuation of the good example: a painting, John Lennon’s last dollar bill";"multi-agent-systems auctions valuation-models"
"Correlated value";"valuations of the good are related, i.e. the more other agents are prepared to pay, the more agent A prepared to pay. example: purchase of items for later resale";"multi-agent-systems auctions valuation-models"

"English Auction";"Auctioneer starts the bidding at some reservation price. Bidders then shout out ascending prices (minimum increments). Once bidders stop shouting, the high bidder gets the good at that price.";"multi-agent-systems auctions single-item-auctions-basic-auction-mechanisms"
"Japanese Auction";"Same as an English auction except that the auctioneer calls out the prices<br>All bidders start out standing. When the price reaches a level that a bidder is not willing to pay, that bidder sits down. Once a bidder sits down, they can't get back up the last person standing gets the good.";"multi-agent-systems auctions single-item-auctions-basic-auction-mechanisms"
"Dutch Auction";"The auctioneer starts ahigh value; it descends clock at some. At some point, a bidder shouts “mine!"" and gets the good at the price shown on the clock. Good when items need to be sold quickly (similar to Japanese auction) No information is given away during auction.";"multi-agent-systems auctions single-item-auctions-basic-auction-mechanisms"
